            <p> Inspired by the world's covid pandemic, the stakeholders got an idea to create a product that will
                help
                the people who work from home usually alone.
                The task was to create <strong class="highlight"> easy to use white noise player </strong> , a
                player
                that
                the users will
                mainly use while
                working or studying. A player that you open to choose and play a sound and leave it like that
                playing in
                the background for the whole working/studying time.</p>
            <p>This was a team project and it was first for all of the members of the team so we all contribute to
                most
                of its stages. Besides this, I can say that in the final stage of the design I mainly focused on the
                prototyping. </p>

            <p> The target users for this project were pre-defined by the stakeholders. Their age range was between
                21-35 years old, our users were people that work from home for some time and try to improve their

                <br>
                <br>
                Having these characteristics in mind we as a team manage to interview more than 10 people in our
                target
                group and learned a few interesting stuff about their perspective on this kind of apps and their

                Two things that we discovered during the interviews that weren't mentioned in the client's brief
                were
                that the users would like to have an option to <strong class="highlight"> automatically mix</strong>
