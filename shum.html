            <p> Inspired by the world's covid pandemic, the stakeholders got an idea to create a product that will help
                the people who work from home usually alone.
                The task was to create <strong class="highlight"> easy to use white noise player </strong> , a player
                that
                the users will
                mainly use while
                working or studying. A player that you open to choose and play a sound and leave it like that playing in
                the background for the whole working/studying time</p>

            <p>In the market research, we have researched several direct and indirect competitors. We found out that
                most
                white
                noise players do not put much effort into the visual appearance of their applications, the main <strong
                    class="highlight">accent</strong>
                of this type of player is on the <strong class="highlight">functionality</strong> and KISS (keep it
                simple, stupid)
                designing principle

            <p> The target users for this project were pre-defined by the stakeholders. Their age range was between
                21-35 years old, our users were people that work from home for some time and try to improve their
                performance and make their working environment as productive as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                Having these characteristics in mind we as a team manage to interview more than 10 people in our target
                group and learned a few interesting stuff about their perspective on this kind of apps and their needs.
                The persona that we designed for was Dorian.

                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="name">Dorian</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Dorian is a 26-year-old programmer who has been working from home for a year due to the pandemic. He
                likes to hike and listen to music and misses the working atmosphere from the office. Dorian is a person
                that believes in constant improvement and likes to try new things.
                <br>
                <br>
                Two things that we discovered during the interviews that weren't mentioned in the client's brief were
                that the users would like to have an option to <strong class="highlight"> automatically mix</strong>
                sounds once they open the app and use a
                <strong class="highlight">timer</strong> for stopping the sound after chosen period of time.
